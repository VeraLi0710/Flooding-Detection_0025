### Project Summary 
The project focused on the significant flooding happened July 2021 in Central Europe based on the Google Earth Engine application. The approach quantifies landscape changes, identifies vulnerable areas and evaluates relations across human activities area, vegetation and risk index, aiming to inform better disaster response, risk reduction, and future planning for similar extreme events.

### Problem Statement 
What were the spatial patterns and magnitude of flood impacts on human-activities area, vegetation and infrastructure during and after the July 2021 floods in Germany? How did these elements recover over time according to satellite observations and spatial analysis in the months following the disaster?

### End User 

This application is designed for the public, disaster management agencies, urban planners, and humanitarian organisations. It provides tools to monitor flood impacts on settlements, vegetation, and infrastructure, enabling informed recovery planning and mitigating risks for future extreme weather events.

### Data
The Data Standard:
```js
var spatialParameters = {  
  resolution: 10, // meters - selected for compatibility with Sentinel data  
  coordinateSystem: 'EPSG:4326')  
```
The analysis leverages Google Earth Engine to access key global datasets:
DEM from SRTM
```js
ee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation')  
```
Daily Precipitation
```js
ee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  
```
Flooding
```js
ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')  
```
VIIRS nightlight data
```js
ee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  
```
WorldPop population distribution.
```js
ee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  
```
Besides, also used data from:


### Methodology
Our workflow combines physical, ecological and social risk factors. Flood extent is mapped via ( ). Vegetation change detection uses NDVI before and after flooding. Nightlight data indicates infrastructure disruptions. Population and rainfall data measure exposure and hazard levels. All indices are normalised and combined for final weighted risk analysis and mapping.


### Interface
The interactive application offers multi-tools:
(Add after all combined)
timeline sliders, heat maps, draw-a-region calculations, and vegetation/infrastructure recovery visualisations. These features prioritise usability, providing stakeholders with insights tailored to planning and recovery scenarios.
Split Panel in () and risk assessment to show the difference after comparison.

### How it Works （500 words)
The application integrates multilayered analyses in a Google Earth Engine (GEE) interface across four key sections:

#### Section 1：Starter Web and Flooding Basic Analysis
Using official EMS data, this section delineates precise flood boundaries by subtracting river channel geometries from observed flood extents, establishing a baseline for impact and risk analysis.

```js
var floodExtent = moselleData.observedEvent.geometry();
var riverGeometry = moselleData.hydrographyA.geometry();
var floodExpansion = floodExtent.difference(riverGeometry, 1);
Map.centerObject(floodExtent, 11);
Map.addLayer(riverGeometry, {color: 'blue'}, 'Inherent River');
Map.addLayer(floodExpansion, {color: 'cyan'}, 'Flood Expansion');
```

#### Section 2：Vegetation Impact & Recovery (Edit this plzzz)
Using MODIS NDVI data, comparing pre-flood and recovery periods. The difference map highlights damaged areas (red) and recovery (green), providing crucial insights into landscape resilience.

```js
var ndviLoss = preFloodNDVI.subtract(postFloodNDVI);  
var recoveryNDVI = recoveryNDVI.divide(preFloodNDVI).multiply(100);  
Map.addLayer(recoveryNDVI, {min: 0, max: 100, palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'Recovery Percentage');  
```

#### Section 3：Night Light Detection
Nightlight data highlight critical infrastructure and potential disruption areas.
```js 
var night = ee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  
  .filterBounds(studyArea)  
  .filterDate('2021-06-01', '2021-06-30')  
  .select('avg_rad')  
  .mean()  
  .clip(studyArea);  

var nightN = night.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  
```

#### Section 4：Risk Assessment
This section integrates environmental and socioeconomic factors into a comprehensive flood vulnerability index, combining hazard likelihood with exposure metrics to produce spatial risk classifications.

**DEM and Terrain**
analysis uses NASADEM elevation data to calculate slope and Topographic Position Index (TPI), where flat areas and depressions are assigned higher risk due to water accumulation.

```js
var dem = ee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation').clip(studyArea);  
var slope = ee.Terrain.slope(dem).unmask(0);  
var tpi = dem.subtract(dem.focal_mean({radius:500,units:'meters'})).unmask(0); 
```

**Population** 
exposure leverages WorldPop’s detailed demographic data, summing across all age and gender bands to identify vulnerable communities：

```js
var popAllBands = ee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  
  .map(function(image) {  
    return image.clip(studyArea);  
  })  
  .reduce(ee.Reducer.sum());  
var pop = popAllBands.select([0]).unmask(0);   
```

**Precipitation**
intensity from NASA’s GPM IMERG quantifies rainfall during the flood period：
```js
var rain = ee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  
  .filterBounds(studyArea)  
  .filterDate(win.preStart, win.preEnd)  
  .select('precipitation')  
  .sum()  
  .rename('RAIN')  
  .clip(studyArea);  
```

**Parameter Normalisation:**
All variables are normalised to a 0-1 scale to enable integration and weighted combination:

```js
var tpiDep = ee.Image(1).subtract(tpi.add(100).divide(200).clamp(0, 1));  
var flowN = flow.divide(20000).clamp(0, 1);  
var rainN = rain.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  
var ndviN = ee.Image(1).subtract(ndvi.add(1).divide(2).clamp(0, 1));  
var popN = pop.divide(34).clamp(0, 1);  
var nightN = night.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  
```

**Risk Index:**
Finally, composite indices for hazard and exposure are computed and combined into a unified risk index. Weightings reflect expert judgement and hydrological modelling (e.g., Triana et al., 2010), balancing influences of terrain, rainfall, flooding extent, population, and infrastructure vulnerability.

```js
var slopeFlat = ee.Image(1).subtract(slope.divide(30).clamp(0, 1));  
var tpiDep = ee.Image(1).subtract(tpi.add(100).divide(200).clamp(0, 1));  
var flowN = flow.divide(20000).clamp(0, 1);  
var rainN = rain.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  
var popN = pop.divide(500).clamp(0, 1);  
var floodCalc = moselleData.observedEvent.reduceToImage({properties:[], reducer:ee.Reducer.countEvery()}).gt(0).unmask(0);  

var hazard = slopeFlat.multiply(0.25)  
  .add(tpiDep.multiply(0.15))  
  .add(flowN.multiply(0.20))  
  .add(rainN.multiply(0.20))  
  .add(floodCalc.multiply(0.20));  

var exposure = popN.multiply(0.4)  
  .add(nightN.multiply(0.6));  

var risk = hazard.multiply(0.5)  
  .add(exposure.multiply(0.5));  
```

**Innovative Platform Highlights**  

- Interactive Split-View Maps enable side-by-side comparison of flood risk factors.  
- Multi-Temporal Nightlight & Vegetation Recovery Analysis track infrastructure and ecosystem impacts across flood phases.  
- Robust Risk Assessment with spatially explicit hazard and exposure indices supports targeted flood management.  
- User-Friendly Drawing & Visualization Tools facilitate stakeholder engagement.  

#### Limitations:

During the processing, we found the following limitations:

-  The Google Earth Engine is not suitable for complex analysis so we had to simplify our analytical procedures to improve visualisation performance.

-  Daily flood extent visualisation showed minimal significant changes, likely due to the canyon terrain of the Moselle River which constrains lateral flood expansion. As noted by Giustarini et al. (2013), SAR systems are side-looking and terrain features can produce radar shadow in steep areas.

- Precipitation data could not be obtained at a finer spatial resolution, limiting analysis of localised rainfall patterns. Population data resolution also constrained our ability to conduct detailed vulnerability assessments.

-  Time range and threshold settings presented challenges. Setting appropriate NDVI and nightlight recovery thresholds required subjective decisions, and our analysis timeframe (July 2021-March 2022) may not capture complete recovery trajectories.

-  Multiple factors beyond flooding might influence the recovery processes observed in nightlight and vegetation data. Natural seasonal changes, human interventions, and economic factors affect these indicators, potentially introducing confounding variables into our risk assessment.
