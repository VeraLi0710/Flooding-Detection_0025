### Project Summary 
The project focused on the significant flooding happened July 2021 in Central Europe based on the Google Earth Engine application. The approach quantifies landscape changes, identifies vulnerable areas and evaluates relations across human activities area, vegetation and risk index, aiming to inform better disaster response, risk reduction, and future planning for similar extreme events.

### Problem Statement 
What were the spatial patterns and magnitude of flood impacts on human-activities area, vegetation and infrastructure during and after the July 2021 floods in Germany? How did these elements recover over time according to satellite observations and spatial analysis in the months following the disaster?

### End User 

This application is designed for the public, disaster management agencies, urban planners, and humanitarian organisations. It provides tools to monitor flood impacts on settlements, vegetation, and infrastructure, enabling informed recovery planning and mitigating risks for future extreme weather events.

### Data
The Data Standard:
```js
var spatialParameters = {  
  resolution: 10, // meters - selected for compatibility with Sentinel data  
  coordinateSystem: 'EPSG:4326')  
```
The analysis leverages Google Earth Engine to access key global datasets:
DEM from SRTM
```js
ee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation')  
```
Daily Precipitation
```js
ee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  
```
Flooding
```js
ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')  
```
VIIRS nightlight data
```js
ee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  
```
WorldPop population distribution.
```js
ee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  
```
Besides, also used data from:


### Methodology
Our workflow combines physical, ecological and social risk factors. Flood extent is mapped via ( ). Vegetation change detection uses NDVI before and after flooding. Nightlight data indicates infrastructure disruptions. Population and rainfall data measure exposure and hazard levels. All indices are normalised and combined for final weighted risk analysis and mapping.


### Interface
The interactive application offers multi-tools:
(Add after all combined)
timeline sliders, heat maps, draw-a-region calculations, and vegetation/infrastructure recovery visualisations. These features prioritise usability, providing stakeholders with insights tailored to planning and recovery scenarios.
Split Panel in () and risk assessment to show the difference after comparison.

### How it Works （500 words)
The application integrates multilayered analyses into a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-based interface with four sections:

#### Section 1： Starter Web and Flooding Basic Analysis
Using official EMS data from (Resource). 
```js
var floodExtent = moselleData.observedEvent.geometry();
var riverGeometry = moselleData.hydrographyA.geometry();
var floodExpansion = floodExtent.difference(riverGeometry, 1);
Map.centerObject(floodExtent, 11);
Map.addLayer(riverGeometry, {color: 'blue'}, 'Inherent River');
Map.addLayer(floodExpansion, {color: 'cyan'}, 'Flood Expansion');
```

#### Section 2: Vegetation Impact & Recovery

Our application visualizes vegetation health changes using MODIS NDVI data, comparing pre-flood and recovery periods. The difference map highlights damaged areas (red) and recovery (green), providing crucial insights into landscape resilience.
```js
// Get MODIS NDVI collections
var leftCollection = ee.ImageCollection("MODIS/006/MOD13Q1")
.filterBounds(studyArea)
.filterDate(leftSeason.start, leftSeason.end);
var rightCollection = ee.ImageCollection("MODIS/006/MOD13Q1")
.filterBounds(studyArea)
.filterDate(rightSeason.start, rightSeason.end);
// Calculate median NDVI for each season
var leftNDVI = leftCollection.select('NDVI').median();
var rightNDVI = rightCollection.select('NDVI').median();
// Calculate difference (right - left)
var ndviDiff = rightNDVI.subtract(leftNDVI)
.clip(studyArea);
// Add the difference layer with custom palette
rightMap.addLayer(ndviDiff, {
min: -2000,
max: 2000, 
palette: ['#FF0000', '#FF4040', '#FF8080', '#FFCCCC','#FFFFFF','#CCFFCC', '#80FF80', '#40FF40', '#00FF00']
}, 'NDVI Difference: ' + rightSeason.name + ' - ' + leftSeason.name);
```

#### Section 3：Night Light Detection
Areas with higher nightlight values typically contain critical infrastructure requiring prioritised protection.
```js
var night = ee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  
  .filterBounds(studyArea)  
  .filterDate('2021-06-01', '2021-07-01')  
  .select('avg_rad')  
  .median()  
  .rename('NIGHT')  
  .clip(studyArea);  
```

#### Section 4：Risk Assessment
This section analysis integrates multiple environmental and socioeconomic factors to create a comprehensive flood vulnerability index.This analytical approach combines hazard likelihood with exposure metrics, producing spatially explicit risk classifications.

##### DEM and Terrain
Terrain analysis using NASADEM elevation data generates slope and topographic position index (TPI). Flat areas and depressions (negative TPI values) receive higher risk scores as they naturally accumulate water. 

```js
var dem = ee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation').clip(studyArea);  
var slope = ee.Terrain.slope(dem).unmask(0);  
var tpi = dem.subtract(dem.focal_mean({radius:500,units:'meters'})).unmask(0); 
```

##### Affected Population  
Population exposure is calculated using WorldPop's high-resolution demographic data. The analysis aggregates population counts across all age and gender bands to identify vulnerable communities:

```js
var popAllBands = ee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  
  .map(function(image) {  
    return image.clip(studyArea);  
  })  
  .reduce(ee.Reducer.sum());  
var pop = popAllBands.select([0]).unmask(0);   
```

##### Precipitation
Precipitation data from NASA's GPM IMERG captures rainfall intensity during the critical flood period (July 14, 2021), identifying areas that received extreme precipitation:
```js
var rain = ee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  
  .filterBounds(studyArea)  
  .filterDate(win.preStart, win.preEnd)  
  .select('precipitation')  
  .sum()  
  .rename('RAIN')  
  .clip(studyArea);  
```

##### Parameter Normalisation
The methodology then normalizes all variables to a common 0-1 scale, enabling their mathematical integration, so they can be weighted or combined together in further analysis.

```js
var tpiDep = ee.Image(1).subtract(tpi.add(100).divide(200).clamp(0, 1));  
var flowN = flow.divide(20000).clamp(0, 1);  
var rainN = rain.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  
var ndviN = ee.Image(1).subtract(ndvi.add(1).divide(2).clamp(0, 1));  
var popN = pop.divide(34).clamp(0, 1);  
var nightN = night.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  
```

##### Risk Index
Final with the system constructs composite indices for hazard and exposure, then combines them into a unified risk index
```js
var hazard = slopeFlat.multiply(0.25)  
  .add(tpiDep.multiply(0.15))  
  .add(flowN.multiply(0.20))  
  .add(rainN.multiply(0.20))  
  .add(floodCalc.multiply(0.20));  

var exposure = popN.multiply(0.4)  
  .add(nightN.multiply(0.6));  

var risk = hazard.multiply(0.5)  
  .add(exposure.multiply(0.5));  
```

##### Limitation:
<<<<<<< HEAD

During the processing, we found the following limitations:

a) The Google Earth Engine is not suitable for complex analysis so we had to simplify our analytical procedures to improve visualisation performance.

b) Daily flood extent visualisation showed minimal significant changes, likely due to the canyon terrain of the Moselle River which constrains lateral flood expansion. As noted by Giustarini et al. (2013), SAR systems are side-looking and terrain features can produce radar shadow in steep areas.

c) Precipitation data could not be obtained at a finer spatial resolution, limiting analysis of localised rainfall patterns. Population data resolution also constrained our ability to conduct detailed vulnerability assessments.

d) Time range and threshold settings presented challenges. Setting appropriate NDVI and nightlight recovery thresholds required subjective decisions, and our analysis timeframe (July 2021-March 2022) may not capture complete recovery trajectories.

e) Multiple factors beyond flooding might influence the recovery processes observed in nightlight and vegetation data. Natural seasonal changes, human interventions, and economic factors affect these indicators, potentially introducing confounding variables into our risk assessment.
