### Project Summary 
The project addresses the significant challenges posed by the July 2021 floods in Central Europe, which resulted in extensive damage to settlements, infrastructure and ecosystems. A comprehensive post-disaster analysis framework is critical to understanding the spatial, temporal, and environmental impacts of disaster events and supporting effective recovery and risk mitigation.

### Problem Statement 
How did the July 2021 extreme flooding event in Central Europe impact different elements (settlements, vegetation, infrastructure), and what spatial patterns emerged during the recovery process as documented through multi-temporal satellite analysis?

### End User 

This application is designed for disaster management agencies, urban planners, and humanitarian organizations. It provides tools to monitor flood impacts on settlements, vegetation, and infrastructure, enabling informed recovery planning and mitigating risks for future extreme weather events.

### Data
Key datasets include Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 optical imagery, DEM from SRTM, VIIRS nightlight data, OpenStreetMap infrastructure layers, and WorldPop population distribution. Supporting layers such as historical flood and climate change projections are also employed for comprehensive assessments.

### Methodology
The methodology integrates:
a) satellite-based flood mapping
b) vegetation impact monitoring using NDVI indices
c) infrastructure recovery tracking with VIIRS data
dï¼‰multi-criteria risk assessment. 
Uniform parameters such as spatial resolution, temporal thresholds and thresholds for flood detection and vegetation damage, ensure data consistency.


### Interface
The interactive application offers tools like timeline sliders, heat maps, draw-a-region calculations, and vegetation/infrastructure recovery visualizations. These features prioritize usability, providing stakeholders with insights tailored to planning and recovery scenarios.

### How it Works 
The application integrates multilayered analyses into a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-based interface:

#### Flooding Detection
Using official EMS data. 
```js
var floodExtent = moselleData.observedEvent.geometry();
var riverGeometry = moselleData.hydrographyA.geometry();
var floodExpansion = floodExtent.difference(riverGeometry, 1);
Map.centerObject(floodExtent, 11);
Map.addLayer(riverGeometry, {color: 'blue'}, 'Inherent River');
Map.addLayer(floodExpansion, {color: 'cyan'}, 'Flood Expansion');
```

#### Settlement Impact Assessment 
VIIRS nightlight changes highlight economic recovery and rebuilding progress. Comparing pre-2021 floods, post-flood periods, and March 2022 data aids in identifying recovery lags.
```js
var preFloodNL = getNightlight('202106', 'Pre-Flood Nightlights');  
var nlChange = postFloodNL.subtract(preFloodNL);  
var nlRecovery = recoveryNL.divide(preFloodNL).multiply(100);  
Map.addLayer(nlRecovery, {min: 0, max: 120, palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'Recovery Percentage');  
```
#### Landscape Changes
Satellite imagery highlights significant landscape alterations, including erosion, sediment deposition, and land cover transitions. Comparing pre-change, post-change periods, and recent data helps identify areas with severe impact.

```js
var preChangeImage = getSatelliteImage('202106', 'Pre-Change Landscape');  
var postChangeImage = getSatelliteImage('202207', 'Post-Change Landscape');  
var landscapeChange = postChangeImage.subtract(preChangeImage);  
var changePercentage = landscapeChange.divide(preChangeImage).multiply(100);  
Map.addLayer(changePercentage, {min: -100, max: 100, palette: ['blue', 'white', 'red']}, 'Landscape Change Percentage');  
```

#### Vegetation Impact & Recovery 
NDVI indices derived from pre- and post-event Sentinel-2 data capture vegetation loss and recovery. Damaged areas are defined as NDVI < 0.3, while recovery assessments track vegetation returning to pre-flood levels (NDVI > 80%).

```js
var ndviLoss = preFloodNDVI.subtract(postFloodNDVI);  
var recoveryNDVI = recoveryNDVI.divide(preFloodNDVI).multiply(100);  
Map.addLayer(recoveryNDVI, {min: 0, max: 100, palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'Recovery Percentage');  
```
#### Infrastructure Recovery
Satellite and remote sensing data showcase infrastructure recovery trends, monitoring road networks, building repairs, and economic activity. Comparing pre- and post-disaster data helps assess progress and pinpoint recovery gaps.
```js
var preDisasterInfra = getSatelliteImage('202001', 'Pre-Disaster Infrastructure');  
var postDisasterInfra = getSatelliteImage('202207', 'Post-Disaster Infrastructure');  
var infraChange = postDisasterInfra.subtract(preDisasterInfra);  
var recoveryProgress = infraChange.divide(preDisasterInfra).multiply(100);  
Map.addLayer(recoveryProgress, {min: 0, max: 150, palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'Infrastructure Recovery Percentage');
```

#### Risk Assessment
The module integrates flood depth, vegetation loss, infrastructure damage, and recovery indices into a weighted risk framework to identify highly vulnerable regions.

```js
var totalRisk = floodRisk.multiply(weights.flood)  
  .add(buildingRisk.multiply(weights.building))  
  .add(channelRisk.multiply(weights.channel))  
  .add(vegRisk.multiply(weights.veg))  
  .add(infraRisk.multiply(weights.infra));  
Map.addLayer(totalRisk, {min: 1, max: 5, palette: ['green', 'yellow', 'orange', 'red', 'darkred']}, 'Risk Levels');  
```
