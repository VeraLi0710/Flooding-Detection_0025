    "text": "(Wyszyńska et al., 2020\nProject Github Link: https://github.com/alteregoyishan/groupwork_0025.git\nAll these sections except ‘how it work’, the word limitation is 100 words. ‘How it work’ is 500 words limitaion. ### Project Summary The project focused on the significant flooding happened July 2021 in Central Europe based on the Google Earth Engine application. The approach quantifies landscape changes, identifies vulnerable areas and evaluates relations across human activities area, vegetation and risk index, aiming to inform better disaster response, risk reduction, and future planning for similar extreme events.\n\nProblem Statement\nWhat were the spatial patterns and magnitude of flood impacts on human-activities area, vegetation and infrastructure during and after the July 2021 floods in Germany? How did these elements recover over time according to satellite observations and spatial analysis in the months following the disaster?\n\n\nEnd User\nThis application is designed for the public, disaster management agencies, urban planners, and humanitarian organisations. It provides tools to monitor flood impacts on settlements, vegetation, and infrastructure, enabling informed recovery planning and mitigating risks for future extreme weather events.\n\n\nData\nThe Data Standard:\nvar spatialParameters = {  \n  resolution: 10, // meters - selected for compatibility with Sentinel data  \n  coordinateSystem: 'EPSG:4326')  \nThe analysis leverages Google Earth Engine to access key global datasets: DEM from SRTM\nee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation')  \nDaily Precipitation\nee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  \nFlooding\nee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')  \nVIIRS nightlight data\nee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  \nWorldPop population distribution.\nee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  \nBesides, also used data from:\n\n\nMethodology\nOur workflow combines physical, ecological and social risk factors. Flood extent is mapped via ( ). Vegetation change detection uses NDVI before and after flooding. Nightlight data indicates infrastructure disruptions. Population and rainfall data measure exposure and hazard levels. All indices are normalised and combined for final weighted risk analysis and mapping.\n\n\nInterface\nThe interactive application offers multi-tools: (Add after all combined) timeline sliders, heat maps, draw-a-region calculations, and vegetation/infrastructure recovery visualisations. These features prioritise usability, providing stakeholders with insights tailored to planning and recovery scenarios. Split Panel in () and risk assessment to show the difference after comparison.\n\n\nThe Application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it Works （500 words)\nThe application integrates multilayered analyses into a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-based interface with four sections:\n\nSection 1： Starter Web and Flooding Basic Analysis\nUsing official EMS data from (Resource).\nvar floodExtent = moselleData.observedEvent.geometry();\nvar riverGeometry = moselleData.hydrographyA.geometry();\nvar floodExpansion = floodExtent.difference(riverGeometry, 1);\nMap.centerObject(floodExtent, 11);\nMap.addLayer(riverGeometry, {color: 'blue'}, 'Inherent River');\nMap.addLayer(floodExpansion, {color: 'cyan'}, 'Flood Expansion');\n\n\nSection 2：Vegetation Impact & Recovery (Edit this plzzz)\nNDVI indices derived from pre- and post-event Sentinel-2 data capture vegetation loss and recovery. Damaged areas are defined as NDVI &lt; 0.3, while recovery assessments track vegetation returning to pre-flood levels (NDVI &gt; 80%).\nvar ndviLoss = preFloodNDVI.subtract(postFloodNDVI);  \nvar recoveryNDVI = recoveryNDVI.divide(preFloodNDVI).multiply(100);  \nMap.addLayer(recoveryNDVI, {min: 0, max: 100, palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'Recovery Percentage');  \n\n\nSection 3：Night Light Detection\nAreas with higher nightlight values typically contain critical infrastructure requiring prioritised protection.\nvar night = ee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  \n  .filterBounds(studyArea)  \n  .filterDate('2021-06-01', '2021-07-01')  \n  .select('avg_rad')  \n  .median()  \n  .rename('NIGHT')  \n  .clip(studyArea);  \n\n\nSection 4：Risk Assessment\nThis section analysis integrates multiple environmental and socioeconomic factors to create a comprehensive flood vulnerability index.This analytical approach combines hazard likelihood with exposure metrics, producing spatially explicit risk classifications.\n\nDEM and Terrain\nTerrain analysis using NASADEM elevation data generates slope and topographic position index (TPI). Flat areas and depressions (negative TPI values) receive higher risk scores as they naturally accumulate water.\nvar dem = ee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation').clip(studyArea);  \nvar slope = ee.Terrain.slope(dem).unmask(0);  \nvar tpi = dem.subtract(dem.focal_mean({radius:500,units:'meters'})).unmask(0); \n\n\nAffected Population\nPopulation exposure is calculated using WorldPop’s high-resolution demographic data. The analysis aggregates population counts across all age and gender bands to identify vulnerable communities:\nvar popAllBands = ee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  \n  .map(function(image) {  \n    return image.clip(studyArea);  \n  })  \n  .reduce(ee.Reducer.sum());  \nvar pop = popAllBands.select([0]).unmask(0);   \n\n\nPrecipitation\nPrecipitation data from NASA’s GPM IMERG captures rainfall intensity during the critical flood period (July 14, 2021), identifying areas that received extreme precipitation:\nvar rain = ee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  \n  .filterBounds(studyArea)  \n  .filterDate(win.preStart, win.preEnd)  \n  .select('precipitation')  \n  .sum()  \n  .rename('RAIN')  \n  .clip(studyArea);  \n\n\nParameter Normalisation\nThe methodology then normalizes all variables to a common 0-1 scale, enabling their mathematical integration, so they can be weighted or combined together in further analysis.\nvar tpiDep = ee.Image(1).subtract(tpi.add(100).divide(200).clamp(0, 1));  \nvar flowN = flow.divide(20000).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar rainN = rain.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar ndviN = ee.Image(1).subtract(ndvi.add(1).divide(2).clamp(0, 1));  \nvar popN = pop.divide(34).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar nightN = night.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  \n\n\nRisk Index\nFinal with the system constructs composite indices for hazard and exposure, then combines them into a unified risk index\nvar hazard = slopeFlat.multiply(0.25)  \n  .add(tpiDep.multiply(0.15))  \n  .add(flowN.multiply(0.20))  \n  .add(rainN.multiply(0.20))  \n  .add(floodCalc.multiply(0.20));  \n\nvar exposure = popN.multiply(0.4)  \n  .add(nightN.multiply(0.6));  \n\nvar risk = hazard.multiply(0.5)  \n  .add(exposure.multiply(0.5));  \n\n\nLimitation:\nDuring the processing, we find the following limitations: a) The Google Earth Engine is not suitable for a complex analysis so we short our analysis to improve the visualisation\n\nWyszyńska, J., et al., 2020.
