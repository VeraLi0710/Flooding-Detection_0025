    "text": "Project Github Link: https://github.com/alteregoyishan/groupwork_0025.git\nGEE Complete Code: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Fverali0710%2Fhello_world%3A0025Final_V2\n\nProject Summary\nThe project focused on the significant flooding happened July 2021 in Central Europe based on the Google Earth Engine application. The approach quantifies landscape changes, identifies vulnerable areas and evaluates relations across human activities area, vegetation and risk index, aiming to inform better disaster response, risk reduction, and future planning for similar extreme events.\n\n\nProblem Statement\nWhat were the spatial patterns and magnitude of flood impacts on human-activities area, vegetation and infrastructure during and after the July 2021 floods in Central Europe? How did these elements recover over time according to satellite observations and spatial analysis in the months following the disaster?\n\n\nEnd User\nThis application is designed for the public, disaster management agencies, urban planners, and humanitarian organisations. It provides tools to monitor flood impacts on settlements, vegetation, and infrastructure, enabling informed recovery planning and mitigating risks for future extreme weather events.\n\n\nData\nOur base data for the Moselle River range, available on the EMS Activation Page, includes boundaries, rivers, buildings, and various other datasets.\nThe Data Standard:\nvar spatialParameters = {  \n  resolution: 10, // meters - selected for compatibility with Sentinel data  \n  coordinateSystem: 'EPSG:4326')  \nThe analysis leverages Google Earth Engine to access key global datasets: DEM from SRTM:\nee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation')  \nDaily Precipitation:\nee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  \nFlooding:\nee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S1_GRD')  \nNDVI:\nee.ImageCollection(\"MODIS/006/MOD13Q1\")\nVIIRS nightlight data:\nee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  \nWorldPop population distribution:\nee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  \nAdditional data sources:\n- German official hydrological station data for flood extent mapping (pegelonline.wsv.de)\n- Detailed precipitation dataset used for rainfall analysis (NASA GPM IMERG)\n\n\nMethodology\nOur workflow combines physical, ecological and social risk factors. Flood extent mapping utilises data provided by German hydrological monitoring stations. Vegetation change detection uses NDVI before and after flooding. Nightlight data indicates infrastructure disruptions. Population and rainfall data measure exposure and hazard levels. All indices are normalised and combined for final weighted risk analysis and mapping.\n\n\nInterface\nThe interactive application provides user-friendly tools designed to support flood risk analysis and stakeholder engagement. We draw inspirations from Earthengine.app (2025a) and Earthengine.app (2025b):\n\nRecovery Monitoring: Multi-temporal analysis of nightlight and vegetation data tracks impacts and recovery of infrastructure and ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Visualisations: Timeline sliders, heat maps, and split-panel views enable side-by-side comparison of flood risk factors and changes over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Drawing & Analysis: Drawing tools facilitate local-scale calculations and enhance communication with stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Assessment Tools: Integrated hazard and exposure indices support targeted and spatially explicit flood management decisions.\n\n\n\nThe Application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it Works\nThe application integrates multilayered analyses in a Google Earth Engine (GEE) interface across four key sections:\n\nSection 1：Starter Web and Flooding Basic Analysis\nUsing official EMS data, this section delineates precise flood boundaries by subtracting river channel geometries from observed flood extents, establishing a baseline for impact and risk analysis.\nvar floodExtent = moselleData.observedEvent.geometry();\nvar riverGeometry = moselleData.hydrographyA.geometry();\nvar floodExpansion = floodExtent.difference(riverGeometry, 1);\nMap.centerObject(floodExtent, 11);\nMap.addLayer(riverGeometry, {color: 'blue'}, 'Inherent River');\nMap.addLayer(floodExpansion, {color: 'cyan'}, 'Flood Expansion');\n\n\n\nSection 2：Vegetation Impact & Recovery\nUsing MODIS NDVI data, comparing pre-flood and recovery periods. The difference map highlights damaged areas (red) and recovery (green), providing crucial insights into landscape resilience.\nvar ndviLoss = preFloodNDVI.subtract(postFloodNDVI);  \nvar recoveryNDVI = recoveryNDVI.divide(preFloodNDVI).multiply(100);  \nMap.addLayer(recoveryNDVI, {min: 0, max: 100, palette: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'Recovery Percentage');  \n\n\n\nSection 3：Night Light Detection\nNightlight data highlight critical infrastructure and potential disruption areas.\nvar night = ee.ImageCollection('NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG')  \n  .filterBounds(studyArea)  \n  .filterDate('2021-06-01', '2021-06-30')  \n  .select('avg_rad')  \n  .mean()  \n  .clip(studyArea);  \n\nvar nightN = night.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  \n\n\n\nSection 4：Risk Assessment\nThis section integrates environmental and socioeconomic factors into a comprehensive flood vulnerability index, combining hazard likelihood with exposure metrics to produce spatial risk classifications.\nDEM and Terrain: analysis uses NASADEM elevation data to calculate slope and Topographic Position Index (TPI), where flat areas and depressions are assigned higher risk due to water accumulation.\nvar dem = ee.Image('NASA/NASADEM_HGT/001').select('elevation').clip(studyArea);  \nvar slope = ee.Terrain.slope(dem).unmask(0);  \nvar tpi = dem.subtract(dem.focal_mean({radius:500,units:'meters'})).unmask(0); \nPopulation: exposure leverages WorldPop’s detailed demographic data, summing across all age and gender bands to identify vulnerable communities：\nvar popAllBands = ee.ImageCollection('WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj')  \n  .map(function(image) {  \n    return image.clip(studyArea);  \n  })  \n  .reduce(ee.Reducer.sum());  \nvar pop = popAllBands.select([0]).unmask(0);   \nPrecipitation: intensity from NASA’s GPM IMERG quantifies rainfall during the flood period：\nvar rain = ee.ImageCollection('NASA/GPM_L3/IMERG_V07')  \n  .filterBounds(studyArea)  \n  .filterDate(win.preStart, win.preEnd)  \n  .select('precipitation')  \n  .sum()  \n  .rename('RAIN')  \n  .clip(studyArea);  \nParameter Normalisation: All variables are normalised to a 0-1 scale to enable integration and weighted combination:\nvar tpiDep = ee.Image(1).subtract(tpi.add(100).divide(200).clamp(0, 1));  \nvar flowN = flow.divide(20000).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar rainN = rain.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar ndviN = ee.Image(1).subtract(ndvi.add(1).divide(2).clamp(0, 1));  \nvar popN = pop.divide(34).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar nightN = night.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  \nRisk Index:\nFinally, composite indices for hazard and exposure are computed and combined into a unified risk index. Weightings reflect expert judgement and hydrological modelling (e.g., Triana et al., 2010), balancing influences of terrain, rainfall, flooding extent, population, and infrastructure vulnerability.\nvar slopeFlat = ee.Image(1).subtract(slope.divide(30).clamp(0, 1));  \nvar tpiDep = ee.Image(1).subtract(tpi.add(100).divide(200).clamp(0, 1));  \nvar flowN = flow.divide(20000).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar rainN = rain.divide(10).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar popN = pop.divide(500).clamp(0, 1);  \nvar floodCalc = moselleData.observedEvent.reduceToImage({properties:[], reducer:ee.Reducer.countEvery()}).gt(0).unmask(0);  \n\nvar hazard = slopeFlat.multiply(0.25)  \n  .add(tpiDep.multiply(0.15))  \n  .add(flowN.multiply(0.20))  \n  .add(rainN.multiply(0.20))  \n  .add(floodCalc.multiply(0.20));  \n\nvar exposure = popN.multiply(0.4)  \n  .add(nightN.multiply(0.6));  \n\nvar risk = hazard.multiply(0.5)  \n  .add(exposure.multiply(0.5));  \n\n\n\nLimitations:\nDuring the processing, we found the following limitations:\n\nThe Google Earth Engine is not suitable for complex analysis so we had to simplify our analytical procedures to improve visualisation performance.\nDaily flood extent visualisation showed minimal significant changes, likely due to the canyon terrain of the Moselle River which constrains lateral flood expansion. As noted by Giustarini et al., 2013, SAR systems are side-looking and terrain features can produce radar shadow in steep areas.\nPrecipitation data could not be obtained at a finer spatial resolution, limiting analysis of localised rainfall patterns. Population data resolution also constrained our ability to conduct detailed vulnerability assessments.\nTime range and threshold settings presented challenges. Setting appropriate NDVI and nightlight recovery thresholds required subjective decisions, and our analysis timeframe (July 2021–March 2022) may not capture complete recovery trajectories.\nMultiple factors beyond flooding might influence the recovery processes observed in nightlight and vegetation data. Natural seasonal changes, human interventions, and economic factors affect these indicators, potentially introducing confounding variables into our risk assessment.\n\n\n\n\nReference:\n\nAmatebelle, C.E., Owolabi, S.T., Abiodun, O. and Okolie, C.C.
